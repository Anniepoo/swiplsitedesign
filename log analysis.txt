Jan sent me a 6.2 gig log file. I've been analyzing the searches from it


The vast majority (about 90%) are indeed searches for substrings of predicate functors.

These could be 'cleaned up' in various ways


There are a fair number of

search(all,summary,'labeling([max(Var)],Vars)'),

type searches, sometimes just with a fragment

search(all,summary,'ord_subset('),

And some people have terrible spelling. Metaphone and spelling corrector matches might be useful

search(all,summary,'suppresing bindings'),
search(all,summary,'lenght of atom'),

Students sometimes haven't internalized that Prolog is case sensitive. Lowercasing searches might make sense.

search(all,summary,'Http'),
search(all,summary,'JSON'),
search(all,summary,'XML'),

On the other hand, module and arity decorations are common
search(all,summary,'http:location'),
search(all,summary,'@/2'),

==========

The next largest category is problems using the development environment
search(all,summary,'% swipl -x'),
search(all,summary,'? swipl -x'),
search(all,summary,'swipl options'),
search(all,summary,trace),
search(all,summary,traceappend),
search(all,summary,'win prolog'),
search(all,summary,'change pl extension'),

search(all,summary,'basic tutor'),

From the many searches like this, it's apparent that many people find their first 10 minutes with SWI-Prolog baffling.

I suggest we produce a starter tutorial page (one for each OS) with an accompanying video, and prominently link to this off the home page.

===============

Slightly separate is install issues.

search(all,summary,'ubuntu dependencies'),

These should point at per-OS install pages. Search issues probably to be subsumed in reorg of the download/install section.

There's a surprising number of searches for specific version numbers.

search(all,summary,'swi prolog 6.0.2'),
search(all,summary,'SWI-Prolog/XPCE 6.0.2 '),

We should make sure specific versions are searchable.

==============

A large category is error messages. A review of swipl's error messages for clarity might be in order. Beyond that, we should make sure we search well for them.

search(all,summary,'retract/1: No permission to modify static procedure'),
search(all,summary,'No permission to modify static procedure'),
search(all,summary,'Singleton variables: [New_Name,New_Budget,New_Model]'),

===============

There are attempts to find modules and files

search(all,summary,'init.pl'),

There are some searches for section names, libraries, and so on
search(all,summary,'library(record)'),

And explicit searches for docs

search(all,summary,'XPCE doc'),
search(all,summary,'XPCE notes'),


=================

There are a suprising number of searches having to do with interop.

Maybe this means we can improve this area of the site.

===============

Then there are what I'm calling 'subject' searches - 
search(all,summary,'delete string in text file'),
search(all,summary,'delete string '),

search(all,summary,'expert system'),

search(app,summary,'DDE'),
search(all,summary,'JSON'),
search(all,summary,'foreign language interface'),
search(all,summary,'installation requirements'),
search(all,summary,'reference books'),
search(all,summary,'SWI-Prolog by Ubuntu'),

I have yet to see a search with a blank that wasn't intended as a phrase.

I suggest we handle these by training a graphmaster based bot.


===============

There are a few searches from programmers obviously coming from some functional language.  There are searches for lambda, cons, and ocaml.
An intro to Prolog for an audience coming from Lisp, Ocaml, Haskell, Clojure, ad nauseum would have an audience.

===================

Occasionally there's a search that's just baffling. There are apparently a number of bored logic programmers in'
the world who have nothing better to do than type strange things into the search box. 

search(all,summary,'_'),
search(all,summary,a),
search(all,summary,'9e9'),
search(all,summary,'9e9ergdfg'),
search(all,summary,a2),
search(all,summary,'_ _'),
search(all,summary,'_ _'),
search(all,summary,'_ _'),
search(all,summary,'_ _'),
search(man,summary,'_ _'),
search(man,summary,'_ _ _'),
search(man,summary,'_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _'),

(the underscores actually match wildcards- Oops, DoS attack!  The last one times out the server, while _ _ returns a lot of stuff).

Some more attacks.

search(all,summary,'\003\\004\\005\\006\\a\b\a\005\\003\\004\\005\\006\\a\b\a\005\Clauses'),
search(all,summary,'\003\\004\\005\\006\\a\b\a\005\\003\\004\\005\\006\\a\b\a\005\Clause'),
search(all,summary,'\003\\004\\005\\006\\a\b\a\005\\003\\004\\005\\006\\a\b\a\005\clause'),

Amusing, rather sad intrusion attempt:

search(all,summary,'<script><marque>heloo</marque></script>'),

others are merely baffling

search(all,summary,'nani search'),

(While on the subject - you should start immediately 404'ing baidu. They're a way overaggressive spider from China. At one point they were over 70% of my own server's traffic.

The various non English submissions are interesting, but localizing the site seems like a huge project. Interestingly, some of them appear to be gibberish - at least Google translate gives up on translating them.

There are a few optimists who have pasted the text of their homework problems into the search box. These folks seem to often be unclear that SWI-Prolog isn't a dialect of Java:

search(all,summary,'Which one of the following bean instances can have a loopback call, allowing the bean instance to behave as a multi-threaded object? '),

=========

bits of humor from log analysis:

somebody's an optimist!

search(all,summary,سمشسا),

Sorry, nope, site's not translated to Arabic.

search(all,summary,тгьиук_срфкы),

No Russian either

and the occasionally just baffling:

search(all,summary,'Excell'),

I SWEAR I didn't do this one:

search(all,summary,':- )'),
