# Style issues

## Issues

  - Vertical alignment of DYK and Search in top bar.
  - Could we use "position: relative" for the content?  That would fix
    positioning the footnotes. Only, the menus will be under the
    contents.  Guess that can be fixed?

## To be discussed with Jessica

  - Overflow handling in navigation tree?
  - Styling of tags
  - Styling of h1..4.  As it is, the difference between headers and
    predicates seems too small.  See e.g., DOCUMENTATION/LICENSE,
    where the predicates are included.
  - Styling of tables?  For example, DOWNLOAD/ADD-ONS
