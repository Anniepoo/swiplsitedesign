Plan of attack:
0.5 Add news   <=== SKIPPED COME BACK
1. Add a marker for each pg style so I can tell what served what
2. Remove the hard code to serve the homepage everywhere. Make it serve
itself where appropriate.
3. Write the new pages, edit others
4. Make all menus & links on homepage work (possibly linking to 404)
5. Cherry out the homepage
6. Reformat 'loose' 1 col pages
7. Reformat manual pages omitting the tree control
8. Reformat pldoc pages omitting the tree control
9. Make the trees work
10. Clean up small stuff

wiki_face

line 747 - \include


started hammering at wiki_face, line 807 doc_wiki.pl
in /usr/lib/swi-prolog/library/pldoc/

I added an additional clause to wiki_face at 807

then in 

wiki.pl 
on line 791 I added iframe_include (and exported at top)

when I return to it I'm going to not make an iframe, I'm going to slurp the file in.

I'll get the file from a non-served location

in parms.pl I added inclusion as a file alias

When you submit patch, don't forget the patch to swipl and to plweb

the swipl install is at

git clone git://www.swi-prolog.org/home/pl/git/pl-devel.git

I cloned but didn't install swipl dev at swiplforpatching so I oculd make patches

Files I changed
/swiplweb/plweb/wiki.pl
/swiplweb/plweb/parms.pl
/usr/lib/swi-prolog/library/pldoc/doc_wiki.pl

OK, I've done it wrong - I've put inline_html_file in wiki.pl.  I need to move it and the line in parms into doc_wiki.pl
